Grade 2/3:
 
Changes:

	1. Divided "GUI" to "User" and "Console"
	2. Removed all static elements and global variables
	3. Removed "Authentication" 
	4. Update diagrams accordingly

Motivation:

1. Divided them to implement model view and model controller seperation.

2. Removed them because they create hidden dependencies that are not necessary. And made public global variables private because of encasulation.

3. After the feedback we noticed that we didnt really need the authentication class because it´s responsability were better in other classes. The autentication class also caused confusion 
   for outsider developers.

4. Update diagrams accordingly to the changes made above.
